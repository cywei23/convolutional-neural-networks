## Multi-Layer Perceptron, MNIST
---
In this notebook, we will train an MLP to classify images from the [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) hand-written digit database.

The process will be broken down into the following steps:
>1. Load and visualize the data
2. Define a neural network
3. Train the model
4. Evaluate the performance of our trained model on a test dataset!

Before we begin, we have to import the necessary libraries for working with data and PyTorch.

## Convolutional Neural Networks
---
In this notebook, we train a **CNN** to classify images from the CIFAR-10 database.

The images in this database are small color images that fall into one of ten classes; some example images are pictured below.
